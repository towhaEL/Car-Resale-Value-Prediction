# Car-Resale-Value-Prediction

To be able to predict used cars market value can help both buyers and sellers. There are lots of individuals who are interested in the used car market at some points in their life because they wanted to sell their car or buy a used car. In this process, it’s a big corner to pay too much or sell less then it’s market value.

In this Project, we are going to predict the Price of Used Cars using various features like Company, Car model, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Year etc. The data used in this project is also given in the repository.
