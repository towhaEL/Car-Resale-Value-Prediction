# üöó Car Resale Value Prediction

Predicting the resale value of used cars can help both **buyers** and **sellers** make informed decisions. Whether you're trying to buy a reliable car without overpaying, or sell one at the right price, understanding market value is essential.

This project uses machine learning to **predict the price of used cars** based on features like company, model, kilometers driven, fuel type, year, and more.
